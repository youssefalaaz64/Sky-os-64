These Magisk modules are simple lightweight and practical for everyday Android use
They improve system behavior without making heavy changes to core system files
At present these modules may not work properly on all devices
This is due to differences in Android versions custom ROMs and hardware configurations
Development is ongoing to expand compatibility across more devices and systems
Future updates will focus on improved detection and broader device support
Users are encouraged to test the modules and report any issues they encounter
Feedback helps identify bugs and device specific problems more efficiently
Each update aims to be more stable and reliable than the previous one
Support for more devices will be added as soon as possible...
