These Magisk modules are designed to be simple lightweight and useful for everyday Android users
They aim to improve system behavior without heavily modifying the core system files
Currently, not all devices can properly detect or run these modules
This is due to differences in Android versions ROMs and device configurations
Work is ongoing to improve compatibility across more devices and systems
Future updates will focus on better detection and broader device support
Users are encouraged to test the modules and report any issues they encounter
Feedback helps identify bugs and device-specific problems faster
Each update will aim to be more stable and reliable than the previous one
Full support for more devices will be added as soon as possible...
