These Magisk modules are made to be simple lightweight and useful for daily Android use
They help improve system behavior without making risky or heavy changes to important system files
Right now the modules may not work perfectly on every device
This is normal because Android versions custom ROMs and hardware are different from one device to another
I am actively working on improving compatibility and adding support for more devices
Future updates will bring better detection wider device support and more stability
Users are welcome to test the modules and report any problems they find
Your feedback is very important and helps make the modules better and more reliable over time
Each update is meant to be better than the one before it
More devices will be supported as development continues
